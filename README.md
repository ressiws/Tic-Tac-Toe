This repository contains a command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++. The game features a player-versus-AI mode where the player competes against an AI opponent.

## ðŸŽˆ Prerequisites

- Install the latest version of [Visual Studio](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads) (the free community edition is sufficient).
    - Install the optional "C++ Universal Windows Platform tools" component.
    - install the latest Windows (10/11) SDK.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Player vs AI: Play against an AI opponent that employs a minimax algorithm to make strategic moves.
- Restart Game: After each game conclusion (win, lose, or tie), players have the option to restart the game for another round.
- Turn Order Adjustment: After a loss, the game ensures that the player who lost gets to start the next game, allowing them to play first.

## ðŸŒ  How to Play

- Clone repository using
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ressiws/Tic-Tac-Toe/
    ```
- Open [Tic-Tac-Toe.sln](/Tic-Tac-Toe.sln) in Visual Studio to build and run the Tic-Tac-Toe game.
